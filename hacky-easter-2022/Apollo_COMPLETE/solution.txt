forbidden when:
any vowel aeiou

.
;
â€™

interesting observations:
$vr probably expands variables
<m> html tags!
{$y??1}

tried all sort of string operations but failed
seems like this is the code that's run on the web server:

<html>
<body>

<?php
$string = "beautiful";
$time = "winter";

$str = "This is a $string $time  morning!";
echo $str. "<br>";

eval("\$str = \"$str\";");
echo $str;
?>
</body>
</html>


The eval piece must be the vulnerable part

next: try different charsets

%u0410p%u043ell%u043e ... was forbidden
(because of the u)

%D0%90 is an A! (Cyberchef Unicode and then URLEncode)
%d0 %be would be the o

... and then I realized that simply sending oct works!
